  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network Mram_storage_21/SPO has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 79 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   Mram_storage_22/SPO,
   Mram_storage_23/SPO,
   Mram_storage_24/SPO,
   Mram_storage_25/SPO,
   Mram_storage_28/SPO
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:2288 - The read port and write port clocks of BRAM
   instance,
   lm32_cpu/instruction_unit/icache/memories[0].way_0_tag_ram/Mram_mem, are
   using the same clock signal (synchronous clocking) with WRITE_FIRST mode
   specified. This configuration may encounter address collisions if the same
   address appears on both ports. It is suggested for this configuration to use
   READ_FIRST mode to avoid any conditions for address collision. See the FPGA
   Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
